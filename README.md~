# Image processing in MATLAB and ROS Motion code

# ROS Motion code instructions
# There are two main programs that must be run for motion
# First download learning ros from here: https://github.com/wsnewman/learning_ros.git
# Next open up Part_5 and remove the cartesian_motion_commander package and replace it with the one in this folder
# The two programs that need to be run are the action server and action client
# Action server can be run using: rosrun irb120_planner irb120_cart_move_as
# Action client can be run using: rosrun cartesian_motion_commander example_generic_cart_move_ac3
